# ROADMAP for commr (TODO)

1. Read two files given their commmand-line arguments
2. Compare files (.lines() method in rust allows us to iterate over each line):
    - B (Line-across-Lines): compare each line in file 1 with each line in file 2 (n^2 Operations)
3. Output 3 columns via STDOUT (unique 1st, unique 2nd, in common)

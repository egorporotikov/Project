# Project (name "Good morning!")

## Problem Statement


As a <user> user
I want to get exercises for morning exersice traning and feel full of power after.  
Targeted group:everyone.  
Warming up is a key of productive day, especialy in winter. When there is dark and cold outside in the morning, we have to find some power for new day.  

<Constraints - What do I not want?>

I don't want to create something, waht i can't perform with RUST.

## Solution (LATER!)
Create a site (application), which will help user to wake up and feel great for new day.
1. Found some simple exercises for training (maybe with description and pictures)
2. Interact with user via special comand like:
- Who are you? (beginner/amateur/beast)
- How mach time do you have today? (5/10/15)
Depends on the answers user will get somme exercises based on the request.

Additionally: use it with alarm. (user wake up with alarm from app and in the same time cann create a programm exercises for warming up)

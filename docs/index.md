# Project: "Good morning!"

## Problem Statement


As a user,
I want to have access to exercises for morning training that help me feel energized and ready to tackle the day.

Target Group: Everyone.

Warming up is key to a productive day, especially in winter. When it’s dark and cold outside in the morning, we need a way to find the energy to face the day ahead.  

<Constraints - What do I not want?>

I don’t want to create something that I can’t implement using RUST.

## Solution (LATER!)
Create a website (or application) that helps users wake up and feel great for the day ahead.

    Provide simple exercises for warming up, including descriptions and pictures.

    Interact with users through specific commands, such as:
        Who are you? (Beginner/Amateur/Beast)
        How much time do you have today? (5/10/15 minutes)

    Based on the user’s answers, the app will generate a personalized exercise routine.

    Additional Feature:
        Integrate the app with an alarm clock. When the user wakes up with the app’s alarm, they can immediately create a personalized morning exercise program.
